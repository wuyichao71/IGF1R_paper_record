# IGF1R paper record

By contrast, even at saturated IGF1 concentrations, IGF1R exclusively forms a Γ-shaped asymmetric dimer with a single IGF1 bound to the site-1. IGF1 is undetectable on the side surface of FnIII-1 in IGF1R, which is equivalent to the site-2 of IR.

The αCT (human IR, residues 693–710; human IGF1R, residues 682–704) form an α-helix and is constitutively associated with the N-terminal L1 domain of IR or IGF1R, together serving as the site-1 for ligand binding.

Given this structural particularity, the disulfide-linked αCTs are likely to play an important role in regulating the activation and function of IR family receptors.
